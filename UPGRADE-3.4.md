# UPGRADE FROM 3.3 TO 3.4

1. A Mollie payment reported as `open` now leaves the Sylius payment in `new` instead of moving it
   to `processing`. In the Payum status flow, `processing` is now reached only from Mollie's
   `pending`.

   Anything that treats `processing` as "the customer started paying" changes meaning: admin grid
   filters, reporting, exports and custom state-machine callbacks.

2. `ConvertMolliePaymentAction` now copies everything describing the Mollie session already tracked
   on the payment into its result: `payment_mollie_id`, `order_mollie_id`, `webhookUrl`, `backurl`
   and `metadata.refund_token`. Payum replaces the payment details with this result on every capture
   while the payment sits in `new`, so a decorating action that drops these keys loses the payment
   link, the abandoned payment link emails and Mollie side refunds for that payment.

   `ConvertMollieSubscriptionPaymentAction` carries the same four top level keys over.

3. `CaptureAction` takes a resolver deciding what to do with a Mollie session already tracked on the
   payment: leave it to the status flow, hand it back to the customer, or replace it. It also takes
   the logger, and records the two Mollie failures it used to swallow: a tracked session it cannot
   read, and a superseded session it cannot cancel.

   ```diff
    public function __construct(
        private OrderRepositoryInterface $orderRepository,
        private MollieApiClientKeyResolverInterface $apiClientKeyResolver,
        private PaymentRepositoryInterface $paymentRepository,
   +    private ExistingMollieSessionResolverInterface $existingSessionResolver,
   +    private MollieLoggerActionInterface $loggerAction,
    ) {
   ```

4. `ChargedSurchargeMatcherInterface` answers which methods reproduce the surcharge already charged
   on an order, and is the single place that comparison lives. Service:
   `sylius_mollie.calculator.payment_fee.charged_surcharge_matcher`.

   `MolliePaymentsMethodResolver` takes it instead of comparing surcharges itself. The argument is
   optional, so a service definition written for 3.3 keeps building, and **not passing it is
   deprecated and it will be required in 4.0**. A resolver built without it cannot compare surcharges
   at all, so after checkout completion it offers only the method the order already carries, which is
   the one that produced its surcharge. Nothing changes during checkout.

   ```diff
    public function __construct(
        private readonly MollieGatewayConfigRepository $mollieGatewayRepository,
        private readonly MollieCountriesRestrictionResolverInterface $countriesRestrictionResolver,
        private readonly ProductVoucherTypeCheckerInterface $productVoucherTypeChecker,
        private readonly PaymentCheckoutOrderResolverInterface $paymentCheckoutOrderResolver,
        private readonly MollieBasedPaymentMethodQueryInterface $mollieBasedPaymentMethodQuery,
        private readonly MollieAllowedMethodsResolverInterface $allowedMethodsResolver,
        private readonly MollieLoggerActionInterface $loggerAction,
        private readonly MollieFactoryNameResolverInterface $mollieFactoryNameResolver,
        private readonly DivisorProviderInterface $divisorProvider,
   +    private readonly ?ChargedSurchargeMatcherInterface $chargedSurchargeMatcher = null,
    ) {
   ```

   `PaymentMethodResolver` takes the same matcher, the Mollie gateway factory checker and the logger.
   All three are optional and **not passing them is deprecated, they will be required in 4.0**: the
   matcher and the checker are deprecated together, since the comparison needs both and a resolver
   missing either offers a placed order only the payment method it already carries; the logger on its
   own, since only the log entries are lost with it missing.

   The plugin's own service definitions pass every one of these arguments, so a shop that did not
   redefine `sylius_mollie.resolver.payment_methods` or
   `sylius_mollie.payment_methods_resolver.mollie_payment` sees no deprecation and gets the new
   behaviour. Redefine them as below to stop the notices.

   ```diff
    public function __construct(
        private readonly PaymentMethodsResolverInterface $decoratedResolver,
        private readonly MollieBasedPaymentMethodQueryInterface $mollieBasedPaymentMethodQuery,
        private readonly MollieFactoryNameResolverInterface $factoryNameResolver,
        private readonly MollieMethodFilterInterface $mollieMethodFilter,
        private readonly EntityManagerInterface $entityManager,
   +    private readonly ?ChargedSurchargeMatcherInterface $chargedSurchargeMatcher = null,
   +    private readonly ?MollieGatewayFactoryCheckerInterface $gatewayFactoryChecker = null,
   +    private readonly ?MollieLoggerActionInterface $loggerAction = null,
    ) {
   ```

5. Once an order has been placed, only methods that keep its total as it stands are offered when
   changing the payment method. Order processors stop running at `cart`, so the surcharge charged on
   a placed order is frozen and can no longer follow the customer's choice. Nothing changes during
   checkout.

   This applies to whole gateways, not just to the Mollie method list. A Mollie gateway is offered
   only when one of its enabled methods reproduces the charged surcharge; every other gateway adds
   no surcharge of its own, so it is offered only when the order carries none. Two consequences:

   - a gateway other than Mollie is no longer offered for an order carrying a Mollie surcharge, so
     it can no longer collect a Mollie fee it never earned;
   - Mollie is no longer offered for an order carrying no surcharge when every one of its enabled
     methods would charge a fee, which used to render an empty method list. A method that reproduces
     the surcharge but is unavailable for other reasons, such as the order total falling outside its
     amount limits, still keeps the gateway on the list, so an empty method list remains possible,
     and the reason is logged.

   When nothing keeps the total, the only method offered is the one the order already carries, since
   that is the method whose surcharge the order is charged, and the reason is logged. The same rule
   applies inside the Mollie method list: when no enabled Mollie method reproduces the charged
   surcharge, the list holds only the method the order already carries. A customer can therefore
   never pay a total that a different method produced, and an order whose configuration has changed
   since it was placed can still be paid, as long as the method it carries is still available. When
   it is not, nothing is offered.

   A surcharge that cannot be compared, meaning a custom calculator that reports no amount or a
   method whose surcharge is configured incompletely, leaves that method out of the comparison. Its
   siblings are still compared, and the Mollie gateway is offered as long as one of them reproduces
   the charged surcharge. The skipped method is recorded in the Mollie log at notice level.
   See point 6.

6. The payment fee calculators in `Sylius\MolliePlugin\Calculator\PaymentFee` also implement
   `PaymentSurchargeAmountCalculatorInterface`, which reports a surcharge instead of applying it
   to an order. `PaymentSurchargeCalculatorInterface` is unchanged and was deliberately left alone
   rather than gaining the new method, because a class implementing it without `calculateAmount()`
   would stop loading altogether.

   So a custom calculator implementing only `PaymentSurchargeCalculatorInterface` keeps applying its
   surcharge exactly as before and needs no change to keep working. What it cannot do is report an
   amount, so the plugin cannot compare its surcharge against the one already on an order. After
   checkout completion such an order is then offered only the method it already carries, which is
   the one that produced its surcharge, and nothing when it carries none. The reason is logged.

   To take part in the comparison, implement `PaymentSurchargeAmountCalculatorInterface` as well and
   have `calculate()` delegate to `calculateAmount()`, which is what the bundled calculators do, so
   the applied and the reported value cannot drift apart.

   Calculated amounts are unchanged. `FixedAmountAndPercentageCalculator` no longer adds and then
   removes intermediate adjustments to arrive at its total, so an order carrying unrelated
   `fixed_fee` or `percentage` adjustments is no longer affected by it.

   Its second and third constructor arguments are now typed
   `PaymentSurchargeAmountCalculatorInterface` instead of `PaymentSurchargeCalculatorInterface`.
   Passing a calculator that implements only the latter no longer type checks.

   ```diff
    public function __construct(
        private readonly AdjustmentFactoryInterface $adjustmentFactory,
   -    private readonly PaymentSurchargeCalculatorInterface $percentageCalculator,
   -    private readonly PaymentSurchargeCalculatorInterface $fixedAmountCalculator,
   +    private readonly PaymentSurchargeAmountCalculatorInterface $percentageCalculator,
   +    private readonly PaymentSurchargeAmountCalculatorInterface $fixedAmountCalculator,
        private readonly DivisorProviderInterface $divisorProvider,
    ) {
   ```

7. The log entry written when a paid Mollie payment is not the one being tracked is now recorded at
   error level rather than as a notice, and its wording changed.

8. That same log entry is no longer written for Order API payment webhooks, where Mollie calls the
   notify token with the `tr_` id of the payment inside the order.

9. `PaymentSurchargeAdjustmentsProviderInterface` is the single source of truth for the adjustment
   types a payment surcharge can produce. `PaymentFeeAdjustmentClearer` reads them from it rather
   than naming three types itself.

   A new parameter has been introduced, `sylius_mollie.payment_surcharge_adjustments`, holding the
   three built in types. Redefine it to have your own surcharge adjustments cleared and compared
   along with them.

   ```diff
   +public function __construct(
   +    private readonly PaymentSurchargeAdjustmentsProviderInterface $surchargeAdjustmentsProvider,
   +) {
   +}
   +
    public function clear(OrderInterface $order): void
   ```

   `PaymentFeeCalculateAction::PAYMENTS_FEE_METHOD` still holds the same three types and still
   works, but the provider is what the plugin now reads.

10. `Sylius\MolliePlugin\Uploader\PaymentMethodLogoUploader` no longer depends on `Gaufrette\Filesystem`.
    It is now constructed with `Sylius\Component\Core\Filesystem\Adapter\FilesystemAdapterInterface`
    (backed by Flysystem, resolved to the same `sylius.adapter.filesystem.default` storage already
    used by Sylius core for images), and the `sylius_mollie.uploader.payment_method_logo` service
    definition has been updated accordingly. This removes the plugin's dependency on
    `knplabs/knp-gaufrette-bundle`, which Sylius core is dropping.

    If you have decorated or otherwise redefined the `sylius_mollie.uploader.payment_method_logo`
    service and pass it a `Gaufrette\Filesystem` argument, update it to inject
    `Sylius\Component\Core\Filesystem\Adapter\FilesystemAdapterInterface` instead. Stored logo files
    are unaffected, as both filesystems resolve to the same directory.

11. `POST /api/v2/shop/orders/{tokenValue}/mollie-methods` rejects a `methodId` that the matching
    `GET` does not offer with a 400, instead of creating a Mollie payment for it. An API client
    therefore reaches the same methods the shop offers, described in point 5.

    `SelectMollieMethodAction` takes the resolver answering which methods are offered:

    ```diff
     public function __construct(
         private readonly OrderRepositoryInterface $orderRepository,
         private readonly EntityManagerInterface $entityManager,
         private readonly MollieApiClientKeyResolverInterface $apiClientKeyResolver,
         private readonly MollieGatewayFactoryCheckerInterface $mollieGatewayFactoryChecker,
         private readonly RepositoryInterface $mollieCustomerRepository,
         private readonly MollieSubscriptionFactoryInterface $subscriptionFactory,
         private readonly MollieSubscriptionRepositoryInterface $subscriptionRepository,
         private readonly PaymentDataCreatorInterface $paymentDataCreator,
         private readonly MollieLoggerActionInterface $logger,
    +    private readonly MolliePaymentsMethodResolverInterface $molliePaymentsMethodResolver,
     ) {
    ```

12. A payment surcharge of type `fixed_fee_and_percentage` requires a surcharge limit, the way
    `percentage` already did. `FixedAmountAndPercentageCalculator` needs the limit to cap its total,
    so a method saved without one could not have its fee calculated, which broke the checkout fee
    call for it.

13. The plugin now supports Sylius 2.3 and Symfony 8, and requires Sylius 2.2.9 or newer.

    Symfony 8 removed the XML configuration format, so every service definition shipped by the plugin
    moved from XML to PHP: `config/services.xml` and `config/services/**/*.xml` became
    `config/services.php` and `config/services/**/*.php`, and `tests/Behat/Resources/services.xml`
    became `tests/Behat/Resources/services.php`. Directory layout, file names, service ids, aliases,
    tags and parameters are unchanged, so nothing has to be adjusted unless your application imports
    a plugin config file by path, in which case only the extension changes:

    ```diff
     imports:
    -    - { resource: "@SyliusMolliePlugin/config/services/resolver.xml" }
    +    - { resource: "@SyliusMolliePlugin/config/services/resolver.php" }
    ```

    Doctrine mappings (`config/doctrine/*.orm.xml`) and validator mappings (`config/validation/*.xml`)
    deliberately stay XML - neither format was removed.

    An application that imports the plugin's Behat services in its own test kernel has to follow the
    same rename, and, if it also loads Sylius' Behat services, pick the format the installed Sylius
    ships (2.3 ships PHP, earlier versions ship XML):

    ```php
    $syliusBehatServices = '../../../vendor/sylius/sylius/src/Sylius/Behat/Resources/config/services';
    $container->import(is_file(__DIR__ . '/' . $syliusBehatServices . '.php') ? $syliusBehatServices . '.php' : $syliusBehatServices . '.xml');
    $container->import('@SyliusMolliePlugin/tests/Behat/Resources/services.php');
    ```

14. Behat is configured in PHP instead of YAML: `behat.yml.dist` became `behat.dist.php`, and
    `tests/Behat/Resources/suites.yml` together with its five suite files became their `.php`
    equivalents. The local override file is now `behat.php` rather than `behat.yml`.

    `friends-of-behat/suite-settings-extension` was dropped - it does not work with Behat 4 - and
    every suite declares its own `->withPaths('features/admin', 'features/shop')`. The unused
    `admin_order_creation` profile, which pointed at a directory that does not exist, was removed.

    Step definitions in `tests/Behat/Context` use `#[Given]`, `#[When]` and `#[Then]` attributes
    instead of docblock annotations.

    `dmore/behat-chrome-extension` was replaced by the maintained `sylius-labs/behat-chrome-extension`
    fork, which keeps the `DMore\ChromeExtension` namespace, and the abandoned `friends-of-behat/mink`
    by `behat/mink`.

15. The test suite runs on PHPUnit 10.5/11 instead of 9.5. `withConsecutive()` expectations were
    rewritten with an invocation matcher, data providers are `public static` and are wired with
    `#[DataProvider]` attributes.

16. PHPStan was upgraded to 2.x. `phpstan-baseline.neon` holds the findings the upgrade surfaced and
    is meant to shrink over time.
